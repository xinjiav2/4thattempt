Night at the Museum Experience:

- Viewed peers' projects and received helpful feedback and criticism on our own.

Future Applications of This Class:

- Can help in a potential computer science career.
- Beneficial for any career requiring collaboration with coworkers.

Personal Growth:

- Learned to reflect on mistakes.
- Developed perseverance through challenges.
- Realized that goals can be achieved by taking one step at a time.

Future Plans for Our Project:

- Implement a feature to race against Nahhur in a final battle through a maze.
- Focus more on refining gameplay instead of adding random new features.

Collaboration & Development:

- Use our multi-person DM to discuss game improvements.
- Plan new feature implementations.
- Find and patch bugs more efficiently.
- Self-Evaluation:

For a self grading, we would give ourselves a 91% because:

- We completed all required tasks.
- Worked outside of school, even in our free time.
- Received feedback from upperclassmen like Srijan.
- Thorughout the entire trimester, We have learned many things that would overall be useful. 
- We always did our work on time, however were neither the first one to finish, nor the last one to finish. 
- The quality of our work was good, however it also was neither both the best quality work, nor was it the worst quality work.
- We have had help from many of our TA's and got ourselves involved within this class.
- We did not have the greatest game, like Evan and West's, however we have still put in a lot of effort, and we were very involved.
- We feel that we do not deserve a grade higher than 0.91 because we were not as great as coding as other people, such as Nikhil or Devon, however wee did understand a decent amount of our code, as well as had some background knowledge (Me in python and Advait in java). Thus, we did understand what we were supposed to do, but just not how. We have spent a lot of our own time outside of class working on things and have been very involved. Thus we deserve a 91%.
