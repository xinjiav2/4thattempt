During Night At The Museuem, we got the majority of our feedback from Srijan, from CSA <br>
Srijan's feedback: <br>
Feedback #1: Instructions page <br>
Srijan found it hard to move around, mostly because we did not have much communication and the total amount of noise in the room. It took him a while to figure out the controls, especially how to interact with the npc's but it would be a lot better if we added a how to play section. <br>
How we would fix it: Within the backstory section we would make a new line, that is mostly just how to play the game, it would say something like, wasd to move, e to interact, and esc to move to the next level. <br>

Feedback #2: Fix horizantal movement <br>
Srijan stated that our character moved horizontally too fast, and we timed the time it takes for him to cross the screen and it was around 0.4 seconds. The game is still playable however just not very fun. <br>
How we would fix it: Our orignal game idea was to make the main character the flash, this way the speed was a aspect of the game. However we already had preexisting sprites and our sprite creator decided that he wanted to spend his time (at home) studying for math. Which I respect. However, this meant that we could not use the flash as a sprite, so we used our old sprites. But this did not go with the game. We just need to edit the files a tiny bit and we will fix this easily. Nothing to large, just so small that its overlooked easily. <br>

Feedback #3: Good Backstory <br>
Srijan said that our overall backstory was good, however we could have tied the game into it more.<br>
How we would fix it: We would write more things about the characters, and add more story. Our game is currently just like a cliffhanger, and after the main enemey introduces himself there is really nothing going on. We could write more things about the game, and this would result in more people understanding the story of our game, and increase enjoyment.
