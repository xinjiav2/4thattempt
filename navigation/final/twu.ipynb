    "For my second tinker, when we paried up to start creating our level, my parter Zhengji and I created our own platformer game, however, unbeknownst to us, we didn't realize that we weren't allowed to make a platformer game as the movement is different from the adventure game, and we also weren't allowed to use our fellow classmates' names. However, while coding the platformer game, I developed my JavaScript skills and learned how to use buttons to initiate different variables and actions.\n",

    "During Night at the Museum, we viewed our peers' projects and got helpful feedback and criticism on our own. In the future, this class can help us in a potential computer science career, and also any career that requires collaboration with coworkers. As individuals, we learned to reflect on our mistakes and keep persevering through tough times and that we can always accomplish whatever we want as long as we go one step at a time. For our project's future, we would like to implement a feature to race against Nahhur in a final battle through a maze, this time focusing more on smoothening out the gameplay instead of rushing and adding new things here and there. In our multi-person DM, we will discuss how we can improve the quality of our game, implement new features, and find a way to find and patch bugs more efficiently. We would give ourselves a 0.9 because we feel that not only did we complete the tasks required, but we also worked outside of school, including our free time, and got feedback and reviews from upperclassmen like Srijan.
