### During Night At The Museum, we got the majority of our feedback from Srijan, from CSA
 <br>
Srijan's feedback: <br>

## Feedback #1: Instructions page
 <br>
 - Srijan found it hard to move around due to a lack of communication and the noise in the room. <br>
 - It took him a while to figure out the controls, especially how to interact with NPCs. <br>
# Suggested improvement: Add a "How to Play" section. <br>
# How we would fix it: <br>
 - In the backstory section, add a new line detailing the controls: "WASD to move, E to interact, ESC to move to the next level." <br>

## Feedback #2: Fix horizontal movement <br>

 - Srijan mentioned the character moved too fast horizontally. It took around 0.4 seconds to cross the screen. <br>
 - While the game is still playable, it’s not very fun. <br>
 # How we would fix it: <br>
 - Originally, the game featured the main character as The Flash, with speed being a key gameplay element. <br>
 - However, due to the unavailability of new sprites and the sprite creator focusing on studying, we couldn’t use The Flash and stuck with old sprites. <br>
 - Plan to make small adjustments to fix the speed issue.

 <br>

## Feedback #3: Good backstory
 <br>
 - Srijan praised the backstory but suggested tying it more into the gameplay. <br>
 
 # How we would fix it: <br>
 - Write more details about the characters and expand the story. <br>
 - Currently, the game feels like a cliffhanger with little development after the main enemy introduces himself. <br>
 - By adding more content, we can improve understanding and increase player enjoyment. <br>


## Overview: <br>

 - Me and Advait have known Srijan since the beginning of the school year, as he is our coach for Del Norte Academic League. <br>
 - He has seen us throughout the game development process and is aware of many of our challenges. <br>
 - We’ve often approached him during practices or after games for advice about this class. <br>
 - He has been aware of every bug and triumph we've had. <br>
 - At the beginning of this trimester, we mainly relied on ChatGPT and W3 Schools for guidance. <br>
 - Thanks to Srijan, we’ve learned to seek advice from others, such as upperclassmen, TAs Rachit and Tanisha, and Saaras, who is also in CSA.
