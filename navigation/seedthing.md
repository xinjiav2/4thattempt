note: don't make a summary
<br>
find something in what their saying in what you need to do/apply to ourselves when talking to mort


<br>
<br>
<br>


what inspired them for stem
<br>
"like to take things apart and put them back together"
<br>
actuall intrest in computers, eg website design and hacking

<br>
<br>

project based person
    likes the fufilment of the projects

<br>
<br>

another project based person
likes the fact that you are very happy to like see it fufiling.

<br>
<br>

we live in san diego
san diego is a tech city
growing up in it pushes on you
stem is large for you.
everywhere is stem

<br>
<br>

how important do you consider your porjects?

<br>

they grade you on if you know how everything works, and not directly on if the code words.
<br>
very similar to live reviews with mort

<br>
<br>

focusing on communicating is important skill

<br>
communication required?
<br>

purdue is more project based, 
but the communication is still nessisary
BE CONSISE ABOUT THE THING YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT

<br>

"tell me about yourself"
very important question to awnser
<br>
one of the most important questions to awnser, never f*** up that question

<br>
mort skills??
<br>
one of the other persons is that mort taught him how to deal with issues and that made him have a lot of benefits
agile methodology
<br>
<br>
before every type of assignment is required to make a flowchart
<br>
flowcharts are enormous, as the programs they has are multiple files long.
<br>
flowcharts are very big part of commiting ideas
<br>
user face diagram are also important.

<br>
<br>

how did high school projects effect it

<br>
internships are really benefitted by the mort classes
<br>
helped one person get through an internship at northop gurman
<br>
a large company usually uses github, being organized with github is very useful.

<br>
<br>

mort things help a lot with clubs
<br>
also helps greatly with projects

<br>

flowcharts are important, flowcharts are used widly, flowcharts are used SO MUCH ITS NOT FUNNY HELP IM GETTING WARDENBURG FLASHBACKS

<br>

yay college
<br>

what is application process
<br>

bro applied to purdue and was not expected to go there and realized holy s*** they are actually good at aerospace im going them
<br>
he also wrote essays for purdue the night before and also said DO NOT DO THAT
<br>
he also only applied for all uc except for berkley, as well as georgia tech & MIT
<br>
he also took a lot of ap's (halp my mom)
<br>
<br>

ivies dont count ap's, most of ap's will not transfer

<br>

ivy person can vouch
goes to engineering school, she has stem prereq
but can also do humanities school as breather
location of coloumbia is good
people on campus are helpful
in essays she talked about projects in apcsa
coloumbia essays are short, 150 words.
she talked about facial detector and provided quote to cheer you up
the project is both technical and ethical
coloumbia likes social and tech stuff

<br>

likes del norte way or not
see if you can find a college with the things you like
suprised by lack of projects
hard to know until your there
explore everything you know, find the one that fits you best

<br>

look at major
look at what the university provides
look at classes that university offers!!
all colleges know about you is grades, essay, personal statement
SHOW PASSION, SHOW WHY YOU BELONG (gohar guide refrence??)

<br>

investigate the classes

<br>

advice for us?

<br>
take cc classes 
prestigious schools will accept cc classes

<br>

TAKE COMMUNITY CLASSES BEFORE

<br>

apparently jobs don't really look at gpa
they look at projects you did, maybe look at gpa
gpa does not reflect on hands on capability/project based capability

<br>
what has helped you a lot in high school?
<br>

building a lot of websites, ask buisnesses if he can remake it
good for making connections, meeting people (possible money???)

<br>

scioly
flight has showed him a new perspective
shows them how it wokrs.

<br>

cyber patriot
secure windows& linux servers
great way to meet people
taked about it while meeting people
northrop gurman is similar to cyberpatriot...kinda

<br>

email a bunch of people, but it helps
if one of the professors has replied, then thats good, you have a person to talk too.

<br>
if you have a passion, stick to the passion
whatever your passionate about, do that thing. 

<br>

basically everyone procrastinated about the college apps

<br>

to maneage stuff people used gitbook or something, just like a lare notebook.

<br>

"the future is cs" - (i forgot his name)
<br>
BUT I AGREE

<br>
EVERYTHING IS IN JYPETER NOTEBOOK (.json)

<br>
best way to find info about internships, go to company website and click on careers, then interns
<br>
also can use indeed.
<br>
also linkedin, search top 300 companies/smaller startup
<br>
messageing people on linkedin (recruiters) can give you a lot of skills
<br>
website skills are important, as internships only have 1 page and a personal websitecan act like a portfolio, in order to help

<br>

and again,, EXPLORE WHATS OUT THERE

<br>
freshman going to college - 
your first internship does not nessisarly need to match your major, its just for internship experience.
<br>
go to carrier fairs! can find a lot of connections
<br>
