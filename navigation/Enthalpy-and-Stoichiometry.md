 - Enthalpy - internal energy of the system.
	 - Really difficult to measure, as some energy is stored as chemical bonds
 - ΔH is enthalpy (delta H)
 - # Energy can be released during a chemical reaction
 - One of the products of a combustion reaction is heat.
 - ## We measure the change in enthalpy (Delta H is the change in energy from reactants to products)
 - The products of a combustion reaction, CO2 and H2O have less stored energy than the reactants.
 - Extra energy not being stored is felt as us by heat energy
 - ΔH = q
 - By measuring the heat gained or lost by surroundings, we can determine the enthalpy change of the system.
