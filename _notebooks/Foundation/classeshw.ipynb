    "## Fridge mini game\n",
    "In the code cell below i would like for you to create a fun fridge mini game where you are looking for a good midnight snack in the dark and you pul out a random food item good or bad.\n",
    "You should be able to complete this Homework activity within 15-20 minutes assuming you fully understand the content presented in our lesson. Alhtough, i do understand that some people may get stuck and need extra time to complete the homework. I think classes and methods are a really good thing to have on a large scale project. Although you could make the game below work with different methoods. Please do not use `chat gpt` I worked hard making this.\n",
    "# What to Do\n",
    "I want you to look through the code and complete the missing pieces and write new code lines to make the game funtion.\n",
    "this is basically a `gambling simulator` but with food.\n",
    "I have porvided \"hints\" in the code.\n",
    "### if you want a challenge dont read the <span style=\"color: green;\">GREEN</span>\n",
    "the green next to code it the real hint if you look at the // above there is description of what you need to do\n",
    "starting from a little above the bottom at the fill in the blank or top is the easiest the `middle is the hardest`.\n",
    "## Grab item\n",
    "I want you to Create a grab item function that will reference the class to randomly pick a food item"
