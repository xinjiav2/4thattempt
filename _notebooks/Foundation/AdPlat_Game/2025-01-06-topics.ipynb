    "In the Adventure plus Plaformer game help system and notebooks, we will guide future developers through a step-by-step process of creating all of the key components of this game. The help system is broken down into various categories (using front matter), each category focusses on a specific aspect of the game, implementation, and suggests hacks for deeper learning. By the end of reviewing the help topics, you will have better understanding of the platformer game components and be encouraged to extend the game."
