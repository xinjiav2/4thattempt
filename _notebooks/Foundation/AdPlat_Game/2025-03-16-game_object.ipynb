    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Animated characters, objects, and backgrounds have been essential parts of video games. Many iconic games, such as Super Mario Bros, use sprite animation to bring their characters to life, making their products more engaging and visually appealing. This blog is a brief exploration of how JavaScript can be used to create simple animations using sprites.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spritesheet Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the animation, you need to find an image that contains each individual frame side by side, also known as a spritesheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Animation is achieved by quickly sequencing through a series of still images in code, allowing the images to appear as if they are moving.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spritesheet Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This spritesheet is used for a player in the game. Each row represents a different orientation of movement: left, right, up, and down.\n",

    "1. A red square for player one and a green square for player two. There are some definitions in the game to support alternatives.\n",

    "## College and Game Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson discusses some key concepts that are a part of the requirements for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Define a **JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and an Object Litteral**. Provide an example from this lesson.\n",
    "   - **JSON**: JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is often used to transmit data between a server and a web application.\n",
    "   - **Object Literal**: An object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. It is a way to create a single object with properties and methods.\n",
    "   - **Example**: The `sprite_data_chillguy` object in the lesson is an example of JSON-like data structure in JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "    const sprite_data_chillguy = {\n",
    "        id: 'Chill Guy',\n",
    "        greeting: \"Hi, I am Chill Guy, the desert wanderer. I am looking for wisdom and adventure!\",\n",
    "        src: sprite_src_chillguy,\n",
    "        SCALE_FACTOR: CHILLGUY_SCALE_FACTOR,\n",
    "        STEP_FACTOR: 1000,\n",
    "        ANIMATION_RATE: 50,\n",
    "        INIT_POSITION: { x: 0, y: height - (height / CHILLGUY_SCALE_FACTOR) },\n",
    "        pixels: { height: 384, width: 512 },\n",
    "        orientation: { rows: 3, columns: 4 },\n",
    "        down: { row: 0, start: 0, columns: 3 },\n",
    "        downRight: { row: 1, start: 0, columns: 3, rotate: Math.PI / 16 },\n",
    "        downLeft: { row: 2, start: 0, columns: 3, rotate: -Math.PI / 16 },\n",
    "        left: { row: 2, start: 0, columns: 3 },\n",
    "        right: { row: 1, start: 0, columns: 3 },\n",
    "        up: { row: 3, start: 0, columns: 3 },\n",
    "        upLeft: { row: 2, start: 0, columns: 3, rotate: Math.PI / 16 },\n",
    "        upRight: { row: 1, start: 0, columns: 3, rotate: -Math.PI / 16 },\n",
    "        hitbox: { widthPercentage: 0.45, heightPercentage: 0.2 },\n",
    "        keypress: { up: 87, left: 65, down: 83, right: 68 }\n",
    "    };\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Define the **difference between an Object Literal and an Instantiated Object**. Find examples in this lesson.\n",
    "    - **Example**: The `sprite_data_chillguy` object is an example of an object literal.\n",
    "    - **Instantiated Object**: An instantiated object is created using a constructor function or class. It is an instance of a class and can have properties and methods defined by the class.\n",
    "    **Example**: The Player object created in the create method of GameLevel.js is an example of an instantiated object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```js\n",
    "    let gameObject = new gameObjectClass.class(gameObjectClass.data, this.gameEnv);\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Explain **the concept of Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. Provide an example from this lesson.\n",
    "    - **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP where a class (child class) can inherit properties and methods from another class (parent class). This allows for code reuse and the creation of more complex objects.\n",
    "    - **Example**: The Player class extends the Character class, inheriting its properties and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```js\n",
    "    class Player extends Character {\n",
    "        constructor(data, gameEnv) {\n",
    "            super(data, gameEnv);\n",
    "            // Additional properties and methods for Player\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "D. Describe **the role of the draw() method** in the animation process. Why is it important?\n",
    "    - **Role of draw() Method**: The draw() method is responsible for rendering the game character on the canvas. It updates the character's appearance based on its current state and position, ensuring smooth animations.\n",
    "    - **Importance**: Without the draw() method, the character would not be displayed on the canvas, and animations would not be possible. It is crucial for visual feedback and the overall gaming experience.\n"
